

This package is where the code that will be used in Team 8's team project will be held.
At the moment of writing this, I am not sure of how many classes will be needed, but i will write on them as I create them.

[1] Run.java
    This is a runnable Java class that extends Application.
    *OLD*

[2] GUI.java
    This is a runnable Java class that extends Application.
    It will be what is ran when the user wants to use our program.
    As a .java class that extends Application, it operates very differently from ordinary Classes that use 'psvm' to run.
    It only runs 'launch()' when ran.
    However, this contains all the stuff inside 'init(...)', 'start(...)' and 'stop(...)'.
    The GUI has a number of options.

[3] CSVReader.java
    This is a class that will be used in 'run.java'.
    It will be used to read a supplied address, and store the lines within it.
    This will be access by whatever class is used to create the line graph graphics.

[4] GraphCreator.java
    This is a class that will be used in order to create and show graphs.
    It shall have two functions; getLargestNumber() and drawGraph().
    This will have one function that will be run inside run.java: drawGraph(). drawGraph() takes 4 things:
    1) What you want to name the graph.
    2) The ArrayList<String[]> that you'd get from reader.returnStoredStringArray() after you reader.loadFile().
    3) Takes stage (yeah, this is the thing next to public void start(stage))
    4)

[4.5] ZoomableGraphCreator.java + ZoomManager
    This is a reworked version of GraphCreator.java.
    Similar to its predecessor, however this one has zoom in functionality.
    To Zoom in,

[6] ConfirmBox.java
    This is a simple class that can be created in any class at (feasibly) any point.
    When an instance is created, it is made to be a confirmation popup.
    It returns a boolean, returning true if 'yes' is pressed, false if 'no' is pressed.

[7] URLFileDownloader.java
    This is a class that will be used in 'run.java'.
    It will be used to download the most up to date version of the file supplied by the .gov site.
    This class will be only be used in 'run.java' in order to download the file.

[8] CreateImage.java
    This will create a image of the graph, and put it into our file folder.
